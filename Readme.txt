NGTetris 1.2 for MirageOS
by Jon Martin

This game is pretty self-explanatory, it's tetris, after-all.
There are three highscores, and moving backgrounds that change every level.

Controls:
	In Game:
		Up/Second: Rotate Clockwise
		Alpha: Rotate Counter-Clockwise
		Left/Right/Down: Move in the respective direction
		Enter: Pause
		Mode: Teacher Key, Exits instantly, and saves game
		Clear: Exit, and clear game
		Y=: drop piece instantly
		Window: to exchange current piece with hold piece

	In Highscores:
		Enter: Confirm
		Alpha: Toggle uppercase/lowercase
		Del: Go back a letter

Updates from v 1.0:
	More backgrounds, so there's less repetition of backgrounds.
	Made tons of optimizations, reducing size to 2773 bytes.
	Removed the screenshot from the file, so it doesn't take 2m anymore.
Updates from v 1.1:
	Even more backgrounds.
	Fixed highscore entry bug.
	Added hold feature that allows you to exchange a piece
	Added lite version, which is 500 bytes less, but doesn't include the 
	scrolling backgrounds.

Bugs Fixed:
	bug that messes with code if you press [del] too much for high scores.
